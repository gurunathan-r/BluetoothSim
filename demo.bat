echo üîµ Bluetooth Simulation Lab - Educational Demo
echo ==============================================
echo.
echo This is a SAFE, EDUCATIONAL simulation tool.
echo All commands and results are FAKE and have NO REAL EFFECTS.
echo.

echo üìö Learning Objectives:
echo - Understand Bluetooth security vulnerabilities
echo - Learn about BlueJacking, Bluesnarfing, and MAC spoofing
echo - Recognize defensive measures and best practices
echo - Develop awareness of wireless security risks
echo.

echo üéØ Available Scenarios:
echo 1. BlueJacking Demonstration
echo 2. Bluesnarfing Demonstration
echo 3. MAC Address Spoofing
echo 4. Crowded Cafe Environment
echo 5. Office Environment
echo.

echo üíª Simulated Commands (NO REAL EFFECTS):
echo - sim scan --range=10 --filter=phone
echo - sim message --from=attacker --to=target --payload="Hello"
echo - sim pull-info --target=device --protocol=OBEX
echo - sim set-mac --device=attacker --mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
echo - sim defend --device=target --action=pairing-protection
echo.

echo üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features:
echo - Prominent safety disclaimers
echo - Ethics quiz for advanced features
echo - Educational focus with learning objectives
echo - No real hardware interaction
echo.
